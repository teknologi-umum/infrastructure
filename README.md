# Infrastructure

This repository contains code and scripts for deploying Teknologi Umum services.

We deploy our own service to our virtual machine (obviously), without having to rely strictly
on a specific cloud provider. This way we can keep track of what kind of things we're currently
running and people can learn on how to manage them as well.
